# Configuration file of local differential privacy experiment

# ========== Cluster configuration ==========
# ip address of the parameter server (need 1 GPU process)
ps_ip: 10.0.0.1

# ip address of each worker:# of available gpus process on each gpu in this node
# Note that if we collocate ps and worker on same GPU, then we need to decrease this number of available processes on that GPU by 1
# E.g., master node has 4 available processes, then 1 for the ps, and worker should be set to: worker:3
worker_ips:
    - 10.0.0.1:[5] # worker_ip: [(# processes on gpu) for gpu in available_gpus] eg. 10.0.0.2:[4,4,4,4] This node has 4 gpus, each gpu has 4 processes.
